It can run fine even on devices incompatible with Windows 11. It is just Windows PE not the regular Windows installation. All you need is a 64 bit processor. It does not need a UEFI BIOS to run.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Note: It is not the Windows Recovery Environment. It is just the Windows PE.

Why I created this?
<br>
Instead of you downloading Windows ADK and its Windows PE add-on and the compiling the output, I decided to upload a compiled version already for everyone to use.
